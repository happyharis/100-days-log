# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Happy Haris

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [9 January, Tuesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 9/1/2018
Basically I did some touch up on my github repo and made some repo private. Worked on my guided project by DataQuest on U.S. birth rate and finally pushed to my repo called [dat_data](https://github.com/happyharis/dat_data).

You can actually modify your print function. 'print(value, sep=' ', end='\n', files=sys.stdout)'. Thus, the challenge was to print a array of number side by side. For example, I want to print a number a range from 1 to 5, thus the end product is 12345. That's so cool. You do not have to split and join and make into an integer. The more I learn about python.

Think this logging is not really in me. Gonna make consistent from now on. Just started in Hacker Rank and manage to do the whole Introduction yesterday. Today, I was doing the next level which is Basic Data types. I start with an empty list and suppose to print out according the specified instructions. For example, 
'''
Input:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

Output:
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
'''

Then I was wondering on how to start. Thus, kinda cheated and saw the discussion tab. And I saw an interesting solution:

'''
N = int(input())
    list = []
    for _ in range(N):
        inputs = input().split()
        cmd = inputs[0]
        args = inputs[1:]
        if cmd != 'print':
            cmd += "(" + ",".join(args) + ")"
            eval("list." + cmd)
        else:
            print(list)
'''

First of all, in Python, an underscore is fling. You use it when you need to and throw it away when it is useless to you. Thus, it just runs through the input and then the eval function was something interesting. Basically, you disect the lines individually and eval parse your arguments and evaluated as Python expressions. COOL!

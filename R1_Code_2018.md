# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Happy Haris

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [9 January, Tuesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 9/1/2018
Basically I did some touch up on my github repo and made some repo private. Worked on my guided project by DataQuest on U.S. birth rate and finally pushed to my repo called [dat_data](https://github.com/happyharis/dat_data).

You can actually modify your print function. `print(value, sep=' ', end='\n', files=sys.stdout)`. Thus, the challenge was to print a array of number side by side. For example, I want to print a number a range from 1 to 5, thus the end product is 12345. That's so cool. You do not have to split and join and make into an integer. The more I learn about python.

### R1D3 13/2/2018
Think this logging is not really in me. Gonna make consistent from now on. Just started in Hacker Rank and manage to do the whole Introduction yesterday. Today, I was doing the next level which is Basic Data types. I start with an empty list and suppose to print out according the specified instructions. For example, 
```
Input:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

Output:
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
```

Then I was wondering on how to start. Thus, kinda cheated and saw the discussion tab. And I saw an interesting solution:

```
N = int(input())
    list = []
    for _ in range(N):
        inputs = input().split()
        cmd = inputs[0]
        args = inputs[1:]
        if cmd != 'print':
            cmd += "(" + ",".join(args) + ")"
            eval("list." + cmd)
        else:
            print(list)
```

First of all, in Python, an underscore is fling. You use it when you need to and throw it away when it is useless to you. Thus, it just runs through the input and then the eval function was something interesting. Basically, you disect the lines individually and eval parse your arguments and evaluated as Python expressions. COOL!

Moreover, list comprehensions are basically nested lists that you can create. The problem is that you have integers X, Y, Z and N where X, Y, Z are a range and you have to find a combination on of the X, Y, Z where is not totalled to N. Thus it looks a bit like:
```
print([[a, b, c] for a in range(X+1) for b in range(Y+1) for c in range(Z+1) if a + b + c != N])
```
So much to learn...

### R1D4 14/2/2018
I was still doing the nested list and it was really hard to solve it. [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/nested-list/problem) is you have a nested list of students and marks and you have to find the students with marks that are the second best. This is what I came up with:

```
python_students = []
    python_marks = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        python_students.append([name, score])
        python_marks.append([score])
   
    lowest_marks = min(python_marks)
    
    while min(python_marks) == lowest_marks:
        python_marks.remove(min(python_marks))

    new_lm = (min(python_marks))[0]
    new_students = []
    for y in python_students:
        if y[1] == new_lm:
            new_students.append(y[0])
            
    new_students.sort()
    for x in new_students:
        print(x)

```
Basically, deleting the max scores and had problems with sorting as if there are more than one student with the same marks, then you have to arrange it correctly. This is python 3 btw. Thus (a bit of a cheat), I'll check the discussions to get the answer and did not manage to find a python 3 answer.
Made my own. TADA!

My improved version:

```
 score = []
  mark = []
  for _ in range(int(input())):
      name = input()
      marks = float(input())
      score.append([name, marks])
      mark.append(marks)

  runner_up = sorted(mark)[1]
  for name, score in sorted(score):
      if score == runner_up:
          print(name) 

```
Problem: what if there are 2 person with the same highest scores.
Still working on it. Then the next prob was quite easy for me: get an average score of a student if you call it.

`print("{0:.2f}".format((sum(student_marks[query_name])/3)))`

Was finding hard for me to get a whole number to make it into 2 decimal places. Finally, format was the answer for it. Keep the challenge going!
